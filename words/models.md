Models of the Interstellar Medium
---------------------------------

Ideally, one would like to consider a fully physically-motivated model of the interstellar medium that can be solved analytically to give a simple equation of state,

$$
	P_{eos} \propto \rho^\alpha~.
$$

This, in practice, is not always possible which has lead several authors to run high resolution, small scale simulations of the evolution of supernova remenants (SNRs) which can then be fit to find a subgrid specification.

There are, of course, other authors who have taken the analytical approach. We will analyse both of these approaches in detail in the following sections.


The Fitting Approach
--------------------

Here we will focus on the work of <that paper that I liked>, however similar work is reported in <other references>.
