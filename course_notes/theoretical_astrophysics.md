Theoretical Astrophysics
========================

Lecture 1
---------

Contents of the Universe:

+ 4% Baryonic
+ 21% Dark Matter
+ 75% Dark Energy

Densities:
$$
	\Omega = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}}~.
$$
$\Omega = 1$ for a flat Universe.

### Dark Matter

Evidence:

+ Galaxy rotation curves (flat)
+ Graviataional lensing (light path distored)
+ BBN (more mass than we predict)

Cosmic structure can rule out some forms of dark matter

### Dark Energy

Produces a repulsive gravitational force.


Lecture 2
---------

Cosmic structure refers to structures of galaxy (kpc) size to about Gpc scales - $10^6$ dynamic range.

Galaxies are gravitationally bound collections of gas, stars, and dark matter.

Galaxy groups have around 10 galaxies in them, whereas galaxy clusters are bigger.

### Growth

Quantum fluctuations in the inflation scalar field generated the initial density fluctuations. These grew by self-gravity.

Inflation predicts a spectrum of density fluctuations:
$$
	|\delta_\kappa|^2 \approx K^n ~ ~ ~ n \approx 1~.
$$

Structure formation is heavily dependent on the nature of the Dark Matter.
