Advanced Astrophysics
=====================

Lecture 1
---------

Image quality is key, and is shown by three things:

+ SNR (signal-to-noise ratio)
+ Spatial resolution
+ Spectral resolution

A better PSF allows for all of these to be increased as it leads to a higher, thinner peak. Spectral resolution can only be as good as the PSF as our slit has to be made wide enough to let through the PSF.

We can characterise image quality using:

+ FWHM
+ Strehl Ratio
+ Included Energy

Our limiting factors:

+ Earth's atmosphere
+ Telescope and instrument
+ Detectors, noise

### The atmosphere

When light comes to Earth, it is initially undisturbed and has lines of constant phase. Then the Earth's atmosphere comes along and ruins everything, distorting this phase.

1. Star emits light
2. Passes through space, undisturbed
3. Hits atmosphere - abberations
4. Hits telescope - optical abberations
5. Hits detector - noise
6. We get the image.

Effects of the Earth's atmosphere:

+ Absorption
+ Dispersion
+ Emission
+ Atmosphereic Turbulence (seeing)


Lecture 2
---------

The effects of seeing can be corrected using adaptive optics. For short exposures without AO, we get a 'speckled' image. Long exposures, seeing evens out.

To combat issues with atmosphere, we put telescopes on mountains:

+ Clear skies
+ Good seeing
+ Dark sky
+ Low humidity (important for IR)

### Telescopes and Imaging Optics

Key factors

+ Diffraction
+ Tracking
+ Abberation

Most large telescopes these days are reflectors, and use Alt-Az mounts.

+ Small focal length
+ Don't suffer from chromatic abberation
+ Can be larger as can be supported from behind
+ Alt-Az requires computer control (vs equitorial)

For very large mirrors, they are segmented and actively controlled to keep their shape so they don't sag.

### Telescope Optics

+ Focal ratio: $f/\# = \frac{f}{d}$.
+ Plate scale: projected angle on the sky to distance on detector (arcsecond/mm).

### Niquist Sampling

A minimum of  pixels per 'resolution element' (seeing or diffraction limit).

### Extra Optics

+ Focal reducers/extenders
+ Focal extenders

Focal extenders have a conjugate plane, which is the perfect place to put a filter/element because it affects all light rays equally.
